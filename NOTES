-=-= Next Steps =-=-
Use new Signals and Actions system to hook into bodies and specify run behavior
Setup timing to use Emscripten run instead of animation.
Setup proper body info types (BRAINS: Just color, CPUs, Markov Brains, etc.)
Build a simple organism (initially non-evolving) to control bodies
Hook virtual hardware into organisms
Hook phenotypes into organisms
Hook proper config into system
Setup "optional" plug-in-like module.
  - Each module should include:
    * a code-header with new code
    * a config-header with setting macros
    * a run-time config file
  - Each header should have a Setup() method that takes in the current world and hooks in
    relevant functions.  This should only be called if the associated run-time config is included.

-=-= Configuration Notes =-=-
Already could add:
- Mutation rate
- Pressure for popping
- Pressure for slowing repro (and by how much?)
- World size / org size

Type of population
- Continuous (default)
- grid-based (square & hex)
- well mixed
- deme variations of above.

Type of organisms:
- Just color
- Virtual CPU
- Markov brains
- (neural net?  CPPN grown?)
- (more traditional GP?)


-=-= Efficiency notes =-=-
* Need to profile whole thing!
* Try images instead of circles in viewer to see if it's faster.
* Pause animation if nothing is happening in physics?
  Find some other speedup mechanism to not process physics?  For example:
    don't compare from orgs that haven't moved, just place them first.
    don't move circles if under a certain threshold (0.5?)
* Print frame rate on the screen so slowdowns can be more easily quantified.

-=-= For CSE 450 =-=-
* Bodies should be able to fire missles
